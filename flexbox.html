    <h1> Thailand </h1>
    <div class="flexbox-container">

        <div class="flexbox-item flextwo">
        <p> From the majestic five-star hotels in Bangkok to simple beach huts in Koh Samui or Koh Samet, accommodation choices are many. From the stunning plains and hills of the Golden Triangle to the wave-lapped white sand beaches of Phuket, Samui and Krabi, the kingdom radiates beauty. Thailand has so much to offer that one visit is never enough â€“ you'll want to come back and discover more time after time.</p>

         <p>The last time I was in Thailand was when I was about 10 years ago. I don't remember much, but there's one thing I remember is that I ate a live crab from a beach because my dad says it was edible. </p>

    <h1> Iceland </h1>
    <div class="flexbox-container container3">
        <div class="felxbox-item flexfive">
            <p> Iceland has so many sightseeing spots you can check out that is worth seeing in person. Iceland is not made of ice! In fact, it's a lot more greener than Greenland. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flexbox-item flexseven">
            <p> Since Iceland is located north, you might get to see the Aurora Borealis if you have a chance. The best time to see the Northern Lights is during the winter, between September and April, when dark and long nights have taken over from the bright summernights in Iceland. I will hopefully go there someday, just once. </p>
